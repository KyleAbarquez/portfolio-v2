                <p>When I’m not in front of my computer, I enjoy playing retro video games, tending to my pet dart frogs, listening to music, and excercising. My design is inspired by the media I surround myself with- video games, music videos, comics, art, toys, anything really. My room is always perfectly in order- I can’t focus unless everything is in its correct spot. I think this translates over to my design process! Haha. I also practice minimalism to a certain extent- only keeping and taking things into my life that I either need or love. Trying to level myself up everyday!</p>

                <h4>Retro Game Collecting With an Emphasis on Trades and Community</h4>
                <h5>Mega Market: An app concept by Kyle Abarquez</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="case-text"><span>Mega Market</span> is an <span>app concept</span> that aims to help retro game collectors  in building their collections via purchases and trades with other hobbyists. Inspired by apps such as Letgo and Mercari, Mega Market aims to streamline the process of listing, finding, and obtaining games- with an emphasis on community interaction.</p>

        <p class="emphasis">
            "Collecting is an experience best shared with other collectors"
        </p>

        <p class="case-text">Admittedly, Mega Market is a concept born from personal interest. I enjoy collecting and playing retro games but sometimes find myself wishing I had more people to talk about the games with. These days, a lot of game collecting is done through ebay. While convenient, it isn’t really too much fun to buy from a faceless ebayer. I wanted to make a specialized app for game collectors in which they can interact with other collectors through trades, purchases, or discussion about the hobby.</p>

        <p class="emphasis">What I've designed for</p>

        <p class="case-text">I chose to first hone in on designing a user flow that represents the main functionality of the app. This is the flow of a user finding a game, constructing an offer for that game, and submitting that offer. In addition to designing this user flow, I also created  cohesive visual design along with some branding to give the app distinct character.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">Research and Planning</h2>
        <div class="case-section-image"></div>

        <p class="case-text">I began by looking at other retro video game collecting websites and apps. By looking at these sites and apps, I was able to nail down the important information points that I needed to include in the user flow. This would help me later in my design process as I would just have to figure out the best way to structure and present this information to the user. This research combined with my own personal knowledge as someone in the hobby helped to really place myself in the mindset of an intended user. Based on this research, I constructed a brief persona to help myself in keeping my intended user in mind through the design process. </p>

        <div class="persona-holder">
            <img src="img/pat.jpg" alt="" class="persona-img">
            <div class="persona-blurb">
                <h3>Patrick, 33</h3>
                <p>Pat is a collector who is interested in adding games to his collection while trading off games that he doesn’t need/ has lost interest in. He is looking for a fun way to discover games and interact with other hobbyists.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="case-text">I also referenced commerce apps such as Depop, Letgo, and Mercari for trending design patterns. I drew inspiration from these sources while envisioning how to mold certain design patterns to fit my app concept. The result of this step was this simple flowchart representing each step of the user flow. This would serve as a road map for the screens that I would be designing for in the next step.</p>

        <img src="img/RM-offer_flow.png" class="case-img margin-top" alt="">

        <h2 class="case-section-title">The Paper Sketches</h2>

        <img src="img/IMG_20181002_222856_073.jpg" alt="" class="case-img">

        <p class="case-text margin-top">The design process begins by churning out quick sketches for possible screen layouts. I like to come up with at least 3 ideas/variations per screen and then decide on the design that best presents the necessary information in the most efficient way. I reason out each design decision in my mind to ensure that there is sound logic behind each choice. </p>

        <p class="case-text margin-top">Once I was satisfied with the basic screen designs, I laid out a flow of higher fidelity paper screens with notes to give more context. It is at this stage where I really solidify how I want the user to receive and interact with the information presented in the interface. I work out every detail of the flow and ensure that there is nothing conflicting within the design. An example of this was deciding if information about a seller’s copy of a game would best presented within a modal or as another screen entirely. If I am unable to reach a definite conclusion on a design decision such as this, I take note to test for it later in the design process. </p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">Lo-Fi Wireframing & Usability Testing</h2>

        <img src="img/wireframes.png" class="case-img " alt="">

        <p class="case-text margin-top">The next step was to translate my paper sketches into low fidelity prototype screens. My goal at this stage is to make a prototype that a user would be able to interact with for usability testing. I made the screens with Sketch App and used Invision to make it interactive.</p>
        <p class="case-text margin-top">Once the prototype was complete, I did some testing. The way I tested my user flow was by giving some of my friends the task of finding a game, and making an offer for that game and then observing how they interacted with the interface while taking note of any hang ups and questions they ask. Some of my findings are listed below.</p>

        <ul class="margin-top list">
            <li>User said text was too small to read comfortably</li>
            <li>User thought a piece of information was a button when actually wasn't</li>
            <li>User didn't know how to comprehend wording on certain headings</li>
            <li>User wanted more information about the game</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="case-text margin-top">With these pain points noted, I went back and made the necessary changes to the design. Once the revisions were made I decided that it was time to begin working on the visual design of the product.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">Nailing Down a Visual Style</h2>

        <img src="img/style-guide.png" class="case-img " alt="">

        <p class="case-text">I wanted to give the app a look that was sleek but also fun to fit the theme of video games. I felt like a color scheme of lime green with greys combined with the “Days One” font face gave the app a nice techy feel that wasn’t overly serious. I chose some minmalist icons with distinct rounded edges to match the main font as well as the logo. Additionally, I created a mascot for the app for added fun and personality. After the art direciton was decided upon, I started applying the styles onto high fidelity prototype screens within Sketch.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">The Final Product</h2>

        <img src="img/hifi.png" class="case-img " alt="">

        <a class="big-btn" href="https://invis.io/GPNXGBTZ6BF" target="_blank">View clickable prototype</a>

        <p class="case-text margin-top">These are the high fidelity screens of the user flow. You can click through the user flow using the highlighted hotspots on the Invision prototype linked above. The screens represent the flow of a user finding a game called "Parappa the Rapper", looking through available copies of that game, then constructing and submitting an offer to a user. This user flow is the result of all previous iterations, testing, and revisions.</p>

                <h5>Mega Market: An app concept by Kyle Abarquez</h5>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="case-text"><span>Mega Market</span> is an <span>app concept</span> that aims to help retro game collectors  in building their collections via purchases and trades with other hobbyists. Inspired by apps such as Letgo and Mercari, Mega Market aims to streamline the process of listing, finding, and obtaining games- with an emphasis on community interaction.</p>

        <p class="emphasis">
            "Collecting is an experience best shared with other collectors"
        </p>

        <p class="case-text">Admittedly, Mega Market is a concept born from personal interest. I enjoy collecting and playing retro games but sometimes find myself wishing I had more people to talk about the games with. These days, a lot of game collecting is done through ebay. While convenient, it isn’t really too much fun to buy from a faceless ebayer. I wanted to make a specialized app for game collectors in which they can interact with other collectors through trades, purchases, or discussion about the hobby.</p>

        <p class="emphasis">What I've designed for</p>

        <p class="case-text">I chose to first hone in on designing a user flow that represents the main functionality of the app. This is the flow of a user finding a game, constructing an offer for that game, and submitting that offer. In addition to designing this user flow, I also created  cohesive visual design along with some branding to give the app distinct character.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">Research and Planning</h2>
        <div class="case-section-image"></div>

        <p class="case-text">I began by looking at other retro video game collecting websites and apps. By looking at these sites and apps, I was able to nail down the important information points that I needed to include in the user flow. This would help me later in my design process as I would just have to figure out the best way to structure and present this information to the user. This research combined with my own personal knowledge as someone in the hobby helped to really place myself in the mindset of an intended user. Based on this research, I constructed a brief persona to help myself in keeping my intended user in mind through the design process. </p>

        <div class="persona-holder">
            <img src="img/pat.jpg" alt="" class="persona-img">
            <div class="persona-blurb">
                <h3>Patrick, 33</h3>
                <p>Pat is a collector who is interested in adding games to his collection while trading off games that he doesn’t need/ has lost interest in. He is looking for a fun way to discover games and interact with other hobbyists.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="case-text">I also referenced commerce apps such as Depop, Letgo, and Mercari for trending design patterns. I drew inspiration from these sources while envisioning how to mold certain design patterns to fit my app concept. The result of this step was this simple flowchart representing each step of the user flow. This would serve as a road map for the screens that I would be designing for in the next step.</p>

        <img src="img/RM-offer_flow.png" class="case-img margin-top" alt="">

        <h2 class="case-section-title">The Paper Sketches</h2>

        <img src="img/IMG_20181002_222856_073.jpg" alt="" class="case-img">

        <p class="case-text margin-top">The design process begins by churning out quick sketches for possible screen layouts. I like to come up with at least 3 ideas/variations per screen and then decide on the design that best presents the necessary information in the most efficient way. I reason out each design decision in my mind to ensure that there is sound logic behind each choice. </p>

        <p class="case-text margin-top">Once I was satisfied with the basic screen designs, I laid out a flow of higher fidelity paper screens with notes to give more context. It is at this stage where I really solidify how I want the user to receive and interact with the information presented in the interface. I work out every detail of the flow and ensure that there is nothing conflicting within the design. An example of this was deciding if information about a seller’s copy of a game would best presented within a modal or as another screen entirely. If I am unable to reach a definite conclusion on a design decision such as this, I take note to test for it later in the design process. </p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">Lo-Fi Wireframing & Usability Testing</h2>

        <img src="img/wireframes.png" class="case-img " alt="">

        <p class="case-text margin-top">The next step was to translate my paper sketches into low fidelity prototype screens. My goal at this stage is to make a prototype that a user would be able to interact with for usability testing. I made the screens with Sketch App and used Invision to make it interactive.</p>
        <p class="case-text margin-top">Once the prototype was complete, I did some testing. The way I tested my user flow was by giving some of my friends the task of finding a game, and making an offer for that game and then observing how they interacted with the interface while taking note of any hang ups and questions they ask. Some of my findings are listed below.</p>

        <ul class="margin-top list">
            <li>User said text was too small to read comfortably</li>
            <li>User thought a piece of information was a button when actually wasn't</li>
            <li>User didn't know how to comprehend wording on certain headings</li>
            <li>User wanted more information about the game</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="case-text margin-top">With these pain points noted, I went back and made the necessary changes to the design. Once the revisions were made I decided that it was time to begin working on the visual design of the product.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">Nailing Down a Visual Style</h2>

        <img src="img/style-guide.png" class="case-img " alt="">

        <p class="case-text">I wanted to give the app a look that was sleek but also fun to fit the theme of video games. I felt like a color scheme of lime green with greys combined with the “Days One” font face gave the app a nice techy feel that wasn’t overly serious. I chose some minmalist icons with distinct rounded edges to match the main font as well as the logo. Additionally, I created a mascot for the app for added fun and personality. After the art direciton was decided upon, I started applying the styles onto high fidelity prototype screens within Sketch.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">The Final Product</h2>

        <img src="img/hifi.png" class="case-img " alt="">

        <a class="big-btn" href="https://invis.io/GPNXGBTZ6BF" target="_blank">View clickable prototype</a>

        <p class="case-text margin-top">These are the high fidelity screens of the user flow. You can click through the user flow using the highlighted hotspots on the Invision prototype linked above. The screens represent the flow of a user finding a game called "Parappa the Rapper", looking through available copies of that game, then constructing and submitting an offer to a user. This user flow is the result of all previous iterations, testing, and revisions.</p>

        <h2 class="case-section-title">For the Future...</h2>

        <p class="case-text margin-bottom">I’m happy that through the design of this flow helped me in solidifying a proof of concept for the app. The big picture of the app includes more features such as collection archival, listing creation, member to member discussion, and more. These are all things that I would like to design solutions for. In doing so, I will be improving my design chops while making the concept even more solid for possible future development.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="case-text">VolunteerMatch.org is a website that is used for the purpose of pairing people with volunteer opportunities that fit them. Through analysis of the current site in addition to research involving user interviews, we observed that VolunteerMatch was not connecting users to fitting opportunities in an efficient enough manner. My group and I set out to design a solution that addresses this problem. We also set out to improve feedback within the process by which users connect with and maintain contact with volunteer organizations.</p>

                My Role

            <p class="case-text">I worked on this project with 2 teammates. We collaborated with strategizing and research. My individual roles with this project were visual style design and high fidelity prototyping.</p>

                Current Site Analysis
            </p>

            <p class="case-text">Research began by taking a look at the current site and finding areas that could be improved to better help users to find volunteer opportunities that fit them. Specific areas of possible improvement are pointed out under each image below.</p>


            <div class="pic-cap-wrap">
                <div class="pic-cap">

                    <img src="img/1x/current-1-100.jpg" class="case-img margin-top" alt="">
                    <p>The landing page presents the user with a hero image with the call to action being a search by location. This can be improved by giving the user more search options. The implementation of an advanced search option was thought of at this point. After the hero image, the rest of the page consists of information about Volunteer Match. This space can be better utilized to help users in finding relevant opportunities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pic-cap">
                    <h6>Search Results Page</h6>
                    <img src="img/1x/current-2_1-100.jpg" class="case-img margin-top" alt="">
                    <p>The search results page design is strangely left justified. The space on the right is not utilized at all. Overall, the page looks dull. It can be improved by implementing a better layout design in addition to some colorful images to add visual interest and excitement. The use of a card style system to display results could be a nice solution for this.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pic-cap">
                    <h6>Opportunity Detail Page</h6>
                    <img src="img/current_3.jpg" class="case-img margin-top" alt="">
                    <p>The opportunity detail page is one example of inconsistency in the site's design language. It switches to this off white color for no apparent reason. The page layout is awkward with information scattered around seemingly haphazardly. This page can be improved by organizing the information in a more thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing manner.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pic-cap">

                    <img src="img/current_4.jpg" class="case-img margin-top" alt="">
                    <p>This page also suffers from the off white color design switch-up. In addition to this, it uses a tabbed navigation to switch between sections. In my opinion, this looks dated. This can be improved with a more modern design.</p>

            <p class="emphasis" id="emphasis-vm">
                User Interviews
            </p>

            <p class="case-text">Our group interviewed several users of the site. From these interviews we were able to take away several pain points that users encounter when using the site. Here are some standout quotes that helped guide the direction of the re-design.</p>

            <div class="quote-wrap">
                <p>“It is never acknowledged that my application was received, reviewed, or even appreciated.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t trust the site to do a good job of matching me. The profile builder looks old and outdated.”</p>
                <p>“The search functionality is lacking a little bit. So I scroll a lot.”</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="emphasis" id="emphasis-vm">Takeaways</h2>

            <p class="case-text">From our site analysis and user interviews, we were able to isolate the specific pain-points which we would adress in the re-design. Some observations that were made during the current site analysis were confirmed by conducting the user interviews. These observations include the dated visual design as well as the inefficient search system. Our main takeaways from the research can be summarized below. These would be the key issues that the re-design would set out to tackle.</p>
